<h3> Experience </h3>

<h4> HubSpot - Software Support </h4>
<h6> Oct 2020 – Present </h6>
HubSpot has given me the opportunity to work remotely, work autonomously, and provide a much more technical level of support. As software support I am responsible for a wide range of duties that include networking and domain registration, web site design, API troubleshooting, and technical troubleshooting of various external code environments. This has allowed me to flex my knowledge that I have aquired at UMBC getting my degree, while also supporting customers in a B2B environment as opposed to retail. My skills acquired at Apple and in other past roles applied nicely here as I pride myself in the ability to translate highly technical concepts to individuals with only a basic understanding of certain tools.

<h4> Apple, Annapolis — Genius </h4>
<h6> May 2020 – Oct 2020 </h6>
As a Genius, I provided insightful advice and friendly, hands-on technical support to people in need. I quickly diagnosed product issues on the spot, explaining situations with patience and compassion. I offered solutions to quickly get users up and running again. I worked to become accustomed to juggling more than one customer simultaneously, while being respectful of their time. I fulfilled Apple’s service commitment with style, speed, and skill. Finding trust of customers and coworkers alike in mentorship, knowledge, and even tips and training. I was constantly striving to improve the customer experience, seek out feedback, and better myself every day. With this role I was able to develop and hone in my customer service skillset.

<h4> Apple, Annapolis — Genius Admin </h4>
<h6> July 2015 – May 2020 </h6>
As a Genius Admin, I managed both repairs and customer relations, making sure that our service experience met expectations. I worked with a team of Geniuses and made sure they had the support, knowledge, and resources they needed to succeed. I was required to maintain turnaround time, complete repair tasks, and keep the Genius Room organized as hundreds of repairs and parts passed through the room each day. I worked closely and was in constant contact with management and leadership teams, sharing data about the statuses of repairs and processes. This role allowed me to build an effective team, and keep things running in a system that involved many moving parts.

<h4> Division of Information Technology, UMBC — Tech Support </h4>
<h6> September 2014 - July 2015 </h6>
I worked as support for this division while attending UMBC. I was responsible for maintaining a Zoho desk ticketing system, as well as assisting students on how to use the schools available resources. I helped to set up computers through the school device management, as well as networking printers. I was frequently working over the phone and email with both students and teachers to troubleshoot issues relating to the school network or school based accounts. This job was a learning experience and jumping off point as I worked while I attained my degree.

<h3> Education </h3>

<h4> University of Maryland, Baltimore County, B.S. Information Systems </h4>
<h6> Spring 2012 - Fall 2018 </h6>

My degree focuses on the fundamentals of computers, networking, and business. I elected to take many additional courses and participated in numerous clubs and activities outside of just my regular coursework. This degree most prepared me for a role in Systems Analysis and Design, Computer Networking, or Health Care Informatics. I enjoyed attending and participating in Hack-a-thons which only furthered my knowledge of programming and version control. I helped lead an Interest Group "Create with Care" which gave back to the community, raised funds for Breast Cancer Research, as well as organized local roadside cleanups.
