HubSpot Interview Prep
______________________
 
<h2> Questions I may be asked: </h2>

   How do you handle dealing with ambiguity?
   * There are several aspects to be sure you are skilled in when dealing with ambiguity being able to cope with change; shifting gears comfortably; deciding and acting without     having the total picture; understanding its okay when things are up in the air; not having to finish things before moving on. I try to make sure that I am conscious of these because in my current role I am regularly dealing with ambiguity.
   How do you handle difficult situations, where a customer may be upset?
   * Acknowledge Align Assure
   Talk about a time where you made a decision you regret how did you fix it?

   * Screen repair probing led to using another phone with mail in repair.
