	Apple, Annapolis — Genius
	May 2020 – Present

As a Genius, I provide insightful advice and friendly, hands-on technical support to people in need.
I quickly diagnose product issues on the spot, explaining situations with patience and compassion. I 
offer solutions to quickly get users up and running again. I have become accustomed to juggling more 
than one customer, while being respectful of their time. I fulfill Apple’s service commitment with 
style, speed, and skill. finding trust of customers and coworkers alike as I offer mentorship, knowledge,
and even tips and training. I am constantly striving for improving the customer experience, seeking out
feedback, and bettering myself every day.

	Apple - At Home Advisor
	March 2020 - Present

During the pandemic I moved to working from home as our stores were shut down. I trained in working with
customers over the phone doing largely the same type of troubleshooting and setting up the same types of
repairs that I would perform in store. Working from home has come with its own set of challenges that
helped me to grow. I have learned to improve my focus, and work ethic. I also improved skills for 
troubleshooting, and aligining with customers without having the device in front of you.   

	Apple, Annapolis — Genius Admin
	July 2015 – May 2020

As a Genius Admin, I managed both repairs and customer relations, making sure that our service experience 
met customer expectations. I worked with a team of Geniuses and made sure they had the support, knowledge, 
and resources they needed to succeed. I was required to maintain turnaround time, complete repair tasks, and 
keep the Genius Room organized as new repairs and products arrived. I was in close and constant contact with 
management and leadership teams, sharing data about the statuses of repairs and processes.

	Division of Information Technology, UMBC — Tech Support
	September 2014 - July 2015

I worked as support for this division while attending UMBC. I was responsible for maintaining a ticketing
system, as well as assisting students on how to use the schools avaliable resources. I helped to set up computers
through the school device management, as well as networking printers. I was frequently working over the phone with
both students and teachers to troubleshoot issues relating to the school network or school based accounts.

	University of Maryland, Baltimore County, B.S. Information Systems
	Spring 2012 - Fall 2018

My degree focuses on the fundementals of computers, networking, and business. I elected to take many additional
courses and participated in numerous clubs and activities outside of just my regular coursework. This degree most
prepared me for a role in Systems Analysis and Design, Computer Networking, or Health Care Informatics. I enjoyed 
attending and participating in Hack-a-thons which only furthered my knowledge of programming and version control. 
I helped lead an Interest Group "Create with Care" which gave back to the community, raised funds for Breast Cancer 
Research, as well as organized local roadside cleanups.
